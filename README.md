# Employee-Management-System
# Abstract
Employees are the backbone of any company, therefore, their management plays a major role in deciding the success of an organization. Employees Management Software makes it easy for the employer to keep track of all records. This software allows the administrator to edit employees, add new employees, transfer/promote/terminate employees. Each employee in the database is associated with a position that can be added and edited when the need arises. Employees can be transferred between positions easily without having to retype back their information in the database. You can check to see if there are duplicate positions/employees in the database. Most of all, the employer can assign tasks to employees and assess their progress in order to keep track of employee performance. 
This system brings about an easy way of maintaining the details of employees working in any organization. It is simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with simple employees system. It is user-friendly and just asks the user to follow step by step operations by giving easy to follow options. It is fast and can perform many operations for a company. The goal of this project is to design and develop an employee management system to fill existing gaps in the electronic management of employees.
